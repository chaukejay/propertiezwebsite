/* This CSS file defines custom transition effects using CSS variables.
    These variables, defined on the :root pseudo-class, allow consistent and 
    adjustable transition effects throughout the application. They are designed 
    to control the timing and behavior of transitions for various CSS
    properties, enhancing user experience and interface dynamics.

:root {
    /* Defines a smooth transition effect for all properties.

    - Properties: all
        Specifies that the transition will apply to all CSS properties that
        change.

    - Duration: 0.8s
        The transition will take 0.8 seconds to complete.

    - Timing Function: cubic-bezier(.25, .8, .25, 1)
        Uses a cubic-bezier curve to control the transition speed over time.
        This particular curve starts slowly, accelerates, and then slows down 
        towards the end, creating a smooth and natural transition effect.
